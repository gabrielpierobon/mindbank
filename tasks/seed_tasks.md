the goal is to create a basic app that will work as a hypothetical home banking app

i want to track down my current cash (liquid and highly liquid assets)

i want to also make it a main feature the possibility to add to my cash the theoretical money I will make today by working for my company. This money is a daily conversion of my monthly income. I can only realise that money if i get to 100% of my daily goals. For now, the daily goals is a slider that goes from 0 to 100% and I can manually put it anywhere

As I slide it, the daily income is progressively added to my global position by the respective percentage

a config section should allow me to add these inputs:

1) balance in my bank account
2) metallic cash possesion in EUR
3) metallic cash possesion in USD (converted to EUR)
4) value of current investments

my home should display the global position including a detail of each source and including the realised hypothetical income

the hypothetical income adds in 2 ways

a) an amount equal to the number of days of the month already closed (eg today is July 8th so I'd realise 8/31 of my monthly income)
b) an amount to be realised today with my effors.... which is added dynamically

The goal of the app is to show my money savings and motivate me to increase it by accomplishing my daily tasks and adding money to my global position.


Your immediate goal:
Create 2 markdown documents:
1) a document for a complte product description and requirements
2) a technical document explaining that this should use python, flask, html and css with javascript. No other framework
3) a document named TASKS.md where you create a comprehensive set of checkboxes with the full end to end planning on how to execute this all the way to an MVP

don't do anything outside this
